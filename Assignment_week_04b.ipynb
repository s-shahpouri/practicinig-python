    "\n",
    "As a data scientist you will work with ordinal or categorical data as well. What are good methods to visualize such data? What are proper statistics to use? What needs to be done in the data preparation steps to conduct certain analysis. During this week we will work with data from a sleeping study. This dataset is not mandatory. You are encouraged to use data from your project when possible. \n",

    "\n",
    "The data is collected from a survey-based study of the sleeping habits of individuals within the US. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a description of each of the variables contained within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enough = Do you think that you get enough sleep?\n",
    "- Hours = On average, how many hours of sleep do you get on a weeknight?\n",
    "- PhoneReach = Do you sleep with your phone within arms reach?\n",
    "- PhoneTime = Do you use your phone within 30 minutes of falling asleep?\n",
    "- Tired = On a scale from 1 to 5, how tired are you throughout the day? (1 being not tired, 5 being very tired)\n",
    "- Breakfast = Do you typically eat breakfast?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two research questions you should answer in this assignment are:\n",
    "1. Is there a differences in Hours sleep caused by having breakfast (yes, no)?\n",
    "2. Is there a differences in Hours sleep caused by having breakfast and the tireness (score)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment consists of 6 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [part 1: load the data](#0)\n",
    "- [part 2: data inspection](#1)\n",
    "- [part 3: check assumptions](#2)\n",
    "   - [check normality 3.1](#ex-31)\n",
    "   - [check equal variance 3.2](#ex-32)\n",
    "- [part 4: prepare the data](#3)\n",
    "- [part 5: answer the research question](#4)\n",
    "- [part 6: enhanced plotting](#5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 till 5 are mandatory, part 6 is optional (bonus)\n",

    "\n",
    "Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the variances between groups versus within groups. It basically determines whether the differences between groups is larger than the differences within a group (the noise). \n",
    "A graph picturing this is as follow: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-019-02300-4/figures/2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, the dependent variable must be a continuous (interval or ratio) level of measurement. For instance Glucose level. The independent variables in ANOVA must be categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables. For instance trial category, time of day (AM versus PM) or time of trial (different categories). Like the t-test, ANOVA is also a parametric test and has some assumptions. ANOVA assumes that the data is normally distributed.  The ANOVA also assumes homogeneity of variance, which means that the variance among the groups should be approximately equal. ANOVA also assumes that the observations are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "A one-way ANOVA has just one independent variable. A two-way ANOVA (are also called factorial ANOVA) refers to an ANOVA using two independent variables. For research question 1 we can use the one-way ANOVA, for research question two we can use two-way ANOVA. But first we need to check the assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is not normally distributed you might want to look for an alternative. See also https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/parametric-and-non-parametric-data/\n"
