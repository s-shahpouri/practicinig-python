    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between stress levels and physical activity has been widely studied, with a significant body of evidence suggesting that physical activity can help to prevent, as well as improve, general physical and mental well-being in the context of stress. However, the specific relationship between stress levels and physical activity in different geographical regions is not well understood. The objective of the current study is to examine the relationship between stress levels and physical activity in participants from different geographical regions within the Lifelines cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will make use of data from the Lifelines cohort, a large-scale population-based study that has been collecting data on the health and well-being of individuals living in the northern Netherlands since 2006. By examining the relationship between stress levels and physical activity in participants from different geographical regions within the Lifelines cohort, this study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between these two factors and how it may vary across different populations. The results of this study will be of great importance for public health and well-being, as they will inform the development of effective interventions aimed at reducing the negative effects of stress and promoting physical activity.\n",
